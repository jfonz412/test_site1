    <p>Sample text to demonstrate paragraphs. Newlines do <strong>NOT</strong> work just by pressing enter, you need to start a new paragraph or use a line break. I am still going to continue to type within this paragraph to create a bigger chunk of text. I love lamp.</p>
    <p>Here's another paragraph, lets see what this looks like</p>
    <p>To demonstrate a list, I am going to list off a number of: </p>

    <ul>
    	<li>Random</li>
    	<li>Ass</li>
    	<li>Things</li>
    </ul>
    <p>...and hope that it works out</p>
    <p>If that doesn't work, might as well give up on my dreams and spend the rest of my days browsing <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit...</a></p>
